        <p>as part of the application process; and</p>
        <p><br />if there are late repayments or default,</p>
        <p>and by proceeding with an application then you consent to this.<br />4.2 When CRAs receive a search request from ALCH they will:</p>
        <p>place a credit search &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; on your business credit file whether or not your application proceeds. If the search was for a credit application the record of that search may be seen by other organisations when your business applies for credit in the future;</p>
        <p><br />place an enquiry or organisational search on the personal credit files of directors, partners, members, beneficial owners and shareholders that have been searched, as well as an associate enquiry search on your personal financial partner&rsquo;s credit file, if they are a director;</p>

If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, the CRAs will record the outstanding debt and, in some cases, the length of time that the debt remains outstanding; other organisations may see these updates and this affect your ability to obtain credit in the future.<br />4.4 Any records shared with CRAs will remain on file for six years after your account is closed, whether any outstanding sums have been settled by you or following a default.<br />4.5 You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK.

        <p>False information and Fraud Prevention Agencies (&lsquo;FPAs&rsquo;)<br />4.6 If you give us false or inaccurate information or if we suspect or identify fraud we may record this and may also pass this information to FPAs (such as CIFAS) and other organisations involved in crime and fraud prevention including law enforcement agencies.<br />4.7 We and other organisations may access and use (a) this information in order to prevent fraud, money laundering or other criminal activity (for example, by checking details on credit applications, for managing credit and recovering debt), (b) information recorded by FPAs from other countries, (c) checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance, and (d) checking details of job applicants and employees. <br />4.8 Please contact us if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies.<br />&nbsp; 5.
